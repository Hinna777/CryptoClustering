Acording to the data we are suppose to scale the data and find the following results
1.Find the Best Value for k Using the Original Scaled DataFrame
2.Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the Original Scaled Data
3.Optimize Clusters with Principal Component Analysis
4.Find the Best Value for k Using the PCA Data
5.Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the PCA Data
